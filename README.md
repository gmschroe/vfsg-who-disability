# Anyone can have a disability

1 in 6 people have a significant disability.

Worldwide, there are 1.3 billion people living with disabilities.

People with disabilities are diverse:
* They can be any sex: 44% are male and 56% are female
* They can be any age: 7% are 0 to 14 years old, 63% are 15 to 59 years old, and 30% are at least 60 years old 
* And they live in countries with different income levels: 7% in low income, 40% in lower-middle income, 33% in upper-middle income, and 20% in high income countries

These factors all impact the health inequities experienced by people with disabilities.
